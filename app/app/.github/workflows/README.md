# DevOps CI/CD Pipeline Demo

This project demonstrates a simple CI/CD pipeline using:

- **GitHub Actions** for automation
- **Node.js + Express** sample application
- **Docker** for containerization

The pipeline installs dependencies, runs tests, and builds a Docker image on every push to the `main` branch.
